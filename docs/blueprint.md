- Background color: Very light blue (#EBF9FF), subtly reminiscent of the primary, but very desaturated, to maintain a light and airy feel.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00FFFF), a vibrant shade of the primary that highlights CTAs, yet isn't overused, maintains user's interest
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short content, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clear section divisions and white space to ensure readability and guide the user through the information.
- Incorporate clean, modern icons related to electricity and management to visually enhance the features and benefits sections.
- Employ subtle transitions and animations to enhance user engagement without overwhelming the user.
